# FizzBuzzApp

### Description 
FizzBuzz is a programming challenge which involves iterating through a sequence of numbers and printing a specific output depending on whether the number is divisible by 3, 5, both, or neither.

- Print "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3.
- Print "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 5.
- Print "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Print the number itself if itâ€™s not divisible by either.

### Technologies Used 
Java: The primary programming language used to implement the FizzBuzz logic.

Java Development Kit (JDK): Necessary to compile and execute the Java code.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse


### Lessons Learned 
Control Flow: Gained experience in structuring if-else statements to handle multiple conditions efficiently

Modulus Operation: Practiced using the modulus operator % to determine the divisibility, which is crucial in this problem.

Conditional Checks: Learned the importance of the order of conditions in an if-else chain to ensure correct and efficient logic flow.
